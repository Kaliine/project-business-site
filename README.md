# Business Site
The project was to create a site for a company of my choice. The website should contain a hero image/video, a sign-up form, and an accordion.

## The problem
My main challenge during this project was the accordion. It was the first time trying out Javascript and I think I mixed up which class was the active button and which one was the closed button. I sorted it by starting over. However, this problem took a long time to fix so I didn't have much time to work on the design or adding more features - like a responsive navbar etc. That's what I would like to be working on next if I had more time.
