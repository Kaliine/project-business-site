# Business Site
The project was to create a site for a company of my choice. The website should contain a hero image/video, a sign-up form, and an accordion.

## The problem
My main problem was with the accordion. It was the first time trying out Javascript and I think I mixed up which class was the active button and which one was the closed button. I sorted it by starting over. I cleared my old code, watched the study material one more time and the code-along video. And I made it work. 
However, this problem took a long time to fix so I didn't have much time to work on the design or adding more features - like a responsive navbar etc. That's what I would like to be working on next if I had more time.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
